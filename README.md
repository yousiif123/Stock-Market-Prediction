# Stock-Market-Prediction
##Project Description:
The stock market is a financial market where publicly traded companies' stocks are bought and sold. The stock market can be a good place for investors to grow their wealth over the long term, as stocks have the potential to generate returns through dividends and capital appreciation. However, it is important to understand that investing in the stock market carries risks, and the value of an investment can go up or down depending on a variety of factors. 
Stock Market Prediction helps you determine the future value of company stock and other financial instruments traded on an exchange.
